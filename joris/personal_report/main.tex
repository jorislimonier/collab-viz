\section{Sankey diagram by Joris LIMONIER}

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Get the project}
My submission for the project of data visualization consists of a Sankey diagram. It is available \href{https://jorislimonier.github.io/projects/collab-data-vis/index.html}{here} \footnote{If the link is dead, go to \href{https://jorislimonier.github.io/}{https://jorislimonier.github.io/}, navigate to ``Projects", then look for ``Collaborative Data Visualization"} and should be viewed in the browser (tested on Chrome), on a computer. The code for the project is posted \href{https://github.com/jorislimonier/collab-viz/tree/main/joris}{on GitHub}.

\subsubsection{Background on Sankey diagrams}
Sankey diagrams are defined as follows: \say{Sankey diagrams are a type of flow diagram in which the width of the arrows is proportional to the flow rate.} \cite{noauthor_sankey_2021} In our case, we have four columns that are linked by flows, representing the number of albums or the number of songs.

\subsubsection{Code structure}
The diagram was created with the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python \cite{van2000python} for data pre-processing (cleaning, formatting, writing).
    \item CSV for the data relative to each passage from one column to another (4 columns, therefore 3 CSV files).
    \item JSON to group the CSV data and put them in a format that can be fed to the D3.js library.
    \item JavaScript (Vanilla) to perform last-minute grouping and filter-relative updates
    \item D3.js \cite{bostock_d_2011} for the interactive data visualization.
\end{itemize}

Let us first detail the data preprocessing part.

\subsection{Data pre-processing}
\subsubsection{Raw data}

We grab the following raw data from the CSV Wasabi datasets that were downloaded.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Album field
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \_id (album id)
              \item id\_artist
              \item genre
          \end{itemize}
    \item Artist field
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \_id (artist id)
              \item type (\textit{e.g.} ``Person", ``Orchestra", ``Group", ...)
              \item gender (male, female, unknown)
          \end{itemize}
    \item Song field
          \begin{itemize}
              \item id\_album
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clean the data}
The number of NaN values varies significantly form column to column. The Id columns don't have any but some columns have many, making them sometimes tedious to work with.
Overall however, the dataset is pretty clean. Barely a few Id's are misformatted and some genres have unexpected characters.

Let us call ``column transfer" (\ct) the passage from one column to another. This is what we feed into D3.js and this is the part with the most impact on the diagram. \\
We clean the data in \href{https://github.com/jorislimonier/collab-viz/blob/main/joris/src/sankey.py}{\textit{sankey.py}}, which contains one class per \ct:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \tg : goes from the artist type to the gender of the artist.
    \item \ga : goes from the gender of the artist to the number of albums produced.
    \item \as : goes from the number of albums produced to the average number of songs per album.
\end{itemize}
The same file also contains the following class:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \sk : contains several functions to go from the individual CT classes to writing the data in the final format.
\end{itemize}

Each of the \ct classes writes a CSV file. Usually, Sankey diagrams have three columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item source : the origin node for this flow
    \item target : the target node for this flow
    \item value : the flow quantity (\ie the number of elements that go from a given source to a given target)
\end{itemize}
The \tg \ct does indeed have these three columns. The \ga and \as \ct's on the other hand, are composed of a fourth column:
\begin{itemize}
    \item genre : the genre of the album
\end{itemize}
This genre column allows to perform the filter operation.

\subsubsection{Transfer the data}
The \sk class has a \(write\_final\_data\) method that takes the three CSV's and writes the format in a JSON file (\href{https://github.com/jorislimonier/collab-viz/blob/main/joris/sankey-genre.json}{sankey-genre.json}), in the format demanded by D3.js. The format is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item nodes:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item index
              \item name
          \end{itemize}
    \item links:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item source
              \item target
              \item genre
              \item value
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
where the set of the node indices is simply a bijection between the unique node names and \(\N_{\geq 0}\).

\subsubsection{Set up filtering}
Filtering is performed in \href{https://github.com/jorislimonier/collab-viz/blob/main/joris/sankey-filter.js}{\textit{sankey-filter.js}}. We allow for a filtering that only takes place for the two last \ct's (\ie \ga and \as), because the \tg \ct concerns artists, not albums (and obviously, artists don't have a genre). \\
We use JavaScript for the filtering part because we need to update the graph when genres are added/removed from the filter list. On each change of the selection dropbox (using an \(eventListener\)), we go through sankey-genre.json and check for each element in the ``links'' list if it is in the list of genres selected by the user. If so, we group it with all other elements going from the same source node to the same target node and sum their values.

\subsubsection{Group genres}
The grouping of genres is performed in \href{https://github.com/jorislimonier/collab-viz/blob/main/joris/src/sankey.py}{\textit{sankey.py}}. It contains a dictionary-like object that is of the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item keys: the new group name.
    \item values: a list of strings. If the old genre contains one of these strings, it will be assigned to the new group which is named after the \textit{key}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Visualization}
\subsubsection{General intention}

This visualization tries to stay close to Schneiderman's mantra: ``Overview, Zoom and Filter on demand" \cite{shneiderman_eyes_1996}. It appeared however that the zoom feature didn't really find any meaningful usecase for this Sankey diagram, which is why it has been omitted.\\
Table \ref{tab:Joris_user_tasks} details the actions available for each of the general task categories.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
                            & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{User task}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Details}}                  \\ \midrule
        \multirow{3}{*}{1.} & \multirow{3}{*}{Overview}              & The artists gender per artist type                    \\

                            &                                        & The number of songs-per-album per number of albums    \\ \midrule

        3.                  & Filter                                 & Only show data for one or more album genres           \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{User tasks for the Sankey Diagram.}
    \label{tab:Joris_user_tasks}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Overview}
Figure \ref{fig:joris_sankey_overview} shows an overview of what the default view looks like. The boxes on top show column names. They could probably be inferred from the node labels, but it is meant to facilitate the User Experience.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/joris-sankey-overview.png}
    \caption{Overview of the default Sankey diagram.}
    \label{fig:joris_sankey_overview}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Select}

If the user wishes to rearrange the nodes from each column, they can drag and drop them. This allows to isolate a single segment of the data for a temporary visualization, \eg if someone wants to see how many female made 3 vs 4 albums with 2 songs/album. The other informations can be dragged to the bottom to disregard them. Figure \ref{fig:joris_sankey_isolate} shows such an operation. Note that this is more of a ``quick-and-dirty'' way of visualizing that more females made 3 albums than 4 albums, rather than a real use case for most of users.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/joris-sankey-isolate.png}
    \caption{Display of the ``quick-and-dirty'' isolation}
    \label{fig:joris_sankey_isolate}
\end{figure}

Moreover, if the user wants to have more information on one specific link, \eg knowing how many artists of unknown gender produced 3 albums, this can be done by hovering over the link. Then a tooltip appears (see Figure \ref{fig:joris_sankey_tooltip}), showing complementary information in the following format:

\begin{align*}
     & \text{source} \to \text{target} \\
     & n \text{ occurences}
\end{align*}
where \(n\) is the link value from the given source to the given target.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/joris-sankey-tooltip.png}
    \caption{Display of the tooltip on hover}
    \label{fig:joris_sankey_tooltip}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Filter}

Subsequently, the user can choose to show the data only for a few genres. The selection dropdown is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:joris_sankey_filter-options}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/joris-sankey-filter-options.png}
    \caption{Display of the filter options where ``Blues'', ``Classical'' and ``Pop'' are selected}
    \label{fig:joris_sankey_filter-options}
\end{figure}

When the user clicks to add/remove a genre from the list, the diagram is recomputed and redisplayed on the page. The width of the links update accordingly, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:joris_sankey_filter-result}. As mentioned previously, only albums have a genre (artists don't), which is why the left-most \ct remains untouched after filtering.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Images/joris-sankey-filter-result.png}
    \caption{Display of the diagram where ``Blues'', ``Classical'' and ``Pop'' are selected}
    \label{fig:joris_sankey_filter-result}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User test}
\subsubsection{Perform tasks}

The user test was performed on 3 testers who agreed that their information is being gathered. They were aged 22-24, with a Bachelor's degree in a scientific discipline.\\
The users were asked the following questions: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Task 1
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item How many men made 5 albums.
              \item On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 means very easy, 5 means very difficult), how hard was that task?
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Task 2
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item How many rap solo artists are women.
              \item On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 means very easy, 5 means very difficult), how hard was that task?
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Task 3
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Can you tell how many solo artists made 3 albums? Why/Why not?
              \item On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 means very easy, 5 means very difficult), how hard was that task?
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Task 1 and 2 were performed successfully by the participants, who found it rather easy to complete (one of them mentions that some time was needed to get familiar with the diagram, since he was not familiar with them). \\
The third task is a trap since there is no \ct that allows to give this information. 2 participants identified that this was impossible, the third one said that the were unable to perform the task (therefore they didn't understand that the task was undoable).

\subsubsection{Debriefing}
The users reported that overall, they enjoyed interacting this visualization (3/3) and that they would recommend it to a friend (3/3). Their least favorite part of the data was that the ``unkown\_genre" genre is over-represented. The way to improve this issue is either to reduce the number of missing values in the data set (but this is a data collection matter, which is not my main concern), or to better group the genres. This can be achieved by two ways: grouping more genres under the ones already present, and adding more grouped genres. \\
One user mentioned that they would have liked to see smooth animations when selecting other genres. This is probably doable through better knowledge of D3.js, but since this was my very first experience with JavaScript at all and since the time was constrained, the final version of my Sankey diagram doesn't contain transitions.
