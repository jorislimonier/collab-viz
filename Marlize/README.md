# Bubble map

The bubble map visualises the number of albums that were released all over the world, as well as the number of awards that albums received in each country.
It can be of interest for people who want to see how these numbers differ from country to country and over time.
The bubblemap visualisation was created using R Shiny, and the most recent version can be found [here](https://marlize-de-villiers.shinyapps.io/Data-Visualisation-Bubblemap/).

The data comes from the [WASABI datasets](https://wasabi.i3s.unice.fr/apidoc/).
The data are quite messy and contain many missing values.
This is the reason why some countries have no data.
