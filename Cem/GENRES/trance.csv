2011,cause you feel like paradise and i need a vacation tonight so if i said i want your body now but you know i'm just your type 
2009,but i can see you your brown skin shinin in the sun i can tell you my love for you will still be strong i can see you your brown skin shinin in the sun out on the road today i saw a deadhead sticker on a cadillac 
2015,someone to cry for someone to fight for someone whose arms will hold you tight enough to be there's someone to cry for 
2001,is the last day that i'm using words lost their meaning let's get unconscious 
2011,baby please don't go if i wake up tomorrow will you still be here i don't know please don't go 
2008,listen to your heart when he's calling for you but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye listen to your heart take a listen to it when he's calling for you listen to your heart take a listen to it there's nothing else you can do
