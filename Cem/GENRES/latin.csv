2005,and when she passes but each day when she walks to the sea i smile but she doesn't see tall and tan and young and lonely 
2016,i don't know what it is that makes me love you so that ever since we met you've had a hold on me i just want to be beside you everywhere i said no matter no matter what you do 
2008,and that i was the star of the movie i was taken to a place out of the middle came a lady spill the wine take that pearl 
2011,when it will be right i don't know what it will be like i don't know we live in hope of deliverance hope of deliverance from the darkness 
2009,fill my heart with song and let me sing forever more in other words please be true in other words i love you
