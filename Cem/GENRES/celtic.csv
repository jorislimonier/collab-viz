2013,i've made up my mind of the lonesome times all the lonesome time i said i've made up my mind 
2007,i'm a dweller on the threshold and i'm waiting at the door and i'm standing in the darkness as i cross the burning ground 
2007,i went home and listened to jimmie rodgers in my lunch-break i'm happy cleaning windows i'm a working man in my prime cleaning windows number a hundred and thirty-six 
2007,send me your bible and it comes right back it comes right back to you and it comes right back to you 
2008,stray so far from your own ones dont care nothing for your soul just one more day one more day with your own ones 
2008,you fill my heart with gladness and you take away my sadness and have i told you lately that i love you you take away my sadness
